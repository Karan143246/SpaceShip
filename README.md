<h1>This is a cool SpaceShip game </h1>
<h2> It is made completely using JAVA </h2>
<h2>Hope you all like it.</h2>

<p>
   In the game, we have our ship on the left side of the frame and some enemy ships come from left to right. Our task is to dodge the enemy ships and score as many points as possible. The enemy ships are able to change their positions so we need to cross the screen and score carefully.</br></br>
  Game rules are :
  <ul>
    <li>Use up, down, left, and right arrow keys to dodge the enemy ships.</li>
    <li>When you cross the right end of the board, your score will increase by 1 point.</li>
    <li> It's an infinite game, it only ends when an enemy ship hits you.</li>
  </ul>
